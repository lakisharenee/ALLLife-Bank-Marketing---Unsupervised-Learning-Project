# ALLLife-Bank-Marketing---Unsupervised-Learning-Project
Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment credit card customers based on their spending patterns and interactions with the bank. By identifying distinct customer personas, the marketing team can create personalized campaigns to acquire new customers, upsell existing ones, and improve customer service strategies.

Objective

The primary goal is to use clustering techniques to:

Identify unique customer groups based on behavior.

Help the marketing team target customers more effectively.

Support the operations team in enhancing customer service.



Key Questions

How many different customer segments exist?

What are the characteristics of each segment?

How can marketing and operations leverage these insights?



Data Preprocessing

The dataset includes customer transaction data, demographics, and interaction history. Key preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values.

Feature scaling (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).

Clustering Approach

Unsupervised Learning Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

Evaluation Metrics:

Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Silhouette Score: Assesses cluster quality.

Number of Segments Identified: 3 unique customer behavior profiles.



Results & Insights

The model identified three distinct customer segments, each with unique spending patterns and banking behaviors. These insights can help tailor marketing strategies, improve product recommendations, and optimize customer service responses.
